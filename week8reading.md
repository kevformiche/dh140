### Chapter Reflection

<i> On Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media </i>

  What caught my attention in this chapter was the participation from the individuals to develop an idea to get the voices that have been silenced 
  back online. Reading this chapter I found it very surprising the power of digital humanities and the far reaching influence it can have on the 
  world. The idea to map location based information and tweets to allow the public have an eye on what was going on in Egypt was a very cool and 
  important to concept for the world to see. However, the access to this technology and the ability that only a very few, as mentioned, wealthy educated
  individuals have to promote this idea is very limited. But the concepts of bringing in many individuals to participate, involve themselves in the democratic
  process and help others seek the freedoms they are searching for, is beneficiary for everyone. 
  
<i> Mapping the 2009 Election Protests in Tehran </i>
  
   This project helped make it more technical and clear for me on how this individual developed the HyperCities platform. I was surprised on the amount of public
   and voluntary data they were able to recieve to make this work. Also having to swtich to proxy servers to avoid government intervention was also very notable
   to do. The participation that is mentioned at the begining of the next chapter is very aparent here, where the individual took that action to help out 
   a community that was being silenced. I found this project super interesting and very inspirational. 

### Questions 

  What can go wrong with releasing information that was at first silenced by the government?
  Are there companies/ individuals profiting of ideas like this?
