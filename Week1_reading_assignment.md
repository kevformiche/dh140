I had the oppurtunity to read Trang VoPham's et al. article, "Emerging trends in geospatial artificial intelligence (geoAI): potential applications for enviormental epidemiology," 
which describes an emerging scientific discipline and its oppurtunity in the field of epidemiology. 
Geospatial artificial intelligence, or geoAI, combines multiple methods in machine learning, data mining, and spatial science to extract spatial data. 
The potential of geoAI in the field of epidemology can help improve the exposure modeling techniques by applying advanced machine learning to process larger sets of spatial data
and extract more meangiful information. 
Examples of using geoAI include predicting enviormental factors whithin a particuar location and time. 
Apart from using predicitive models and capturing objects from remote sensing data, the potential of geoAI can help develop a better undestanding of health outcomes from enviormental exposures
as well as improving computational efficiency. 

What I found most interesting from this article was how existing discilpines helped develop this new interdisciplinary science that can be used to discover new ideas in the spatial data field.
Particularly, I was fascinated to learn how geoAI was able to help identify objects that were once difficult to capture and also develop high resolution images of enviormental exposures that could not be done before.
By reading this article, I understand that it takes more than just one academic discipline to help answer or develop a research question. Using data science, spatial datasets and machine learning
could enable my questions to be answered in a broad or in a more specific way. 
When reaching my data science goals, I want to be able to use multiple disciplines to help answer my research and help present it to my audience that makes sense. 
By focusing on gathering my data, extracting what is most meaningful, and creating visualizations for presentation would allow me to reach my goals.
