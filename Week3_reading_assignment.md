### Week 3 Reading Assignment
#### Data for Humanitarian Causes
##### By Keven Michel 

After watching this video, I was really moved on the potential that open data has to help communities that have been impacted 
by natural disasters. In addition, it allowed me to gain a better understanding of how some communities in the world do not have access
to map resources that have the potential of preventing disasters in urban settings. For example, communities affected by the spread of COVID 
can use open data to help map where the spread is in order to prevent more individuals from contracting it. I think open data can benefit a lot of 
communities and local business. For example, using open/public geospatial data that shows the movement of vehicles in a particular time and location could
help small business with prioritizing ads. There is also a possibility for communities that could use open data to help better roads or develop more
efficient infastructure. The potential of open data can help improve the lives of many communities that are underrepresented and underserved compared to their 
counterparts. Using open data, we can build maps to help explain health care disparities, disparities in education, racial inequity 
and help map income gaps in key regions that can offer solutions to these issues one day.
